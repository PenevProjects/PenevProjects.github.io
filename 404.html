								My name is Kaloyan Penev. I like programming and creative expression!
								While I do enjoy individual academic pondering and problem-solving, I find myself working best in teams of like-minded people.
								A life of team sports, from football through basketball to volleyball (the current passion),
								has taught me the discipline to stay dedicated to the process, the self-control to stay calm in stressful situations and the joy that comes with the journey.
								Let's learn and grow together! :)<br>
								<br>
								<h2 class="major"> Fields of study </h2>
								<h2>Augmented Reality</h2> I am currently working on the <a href="https://www.vista-ar.eu/en/">VISTA AR</a> research project for Bournemouth University. The project aims to integrate Extended Reality (XR) technology into a tourism experience. As a result, I have had the pleasure to work with Unity's newest Augmented Reality technology, which has shown me how cool (and complicated!) AR can be, so I am now learning more about it.
								<br><br>
								<h2> Artificial Intelligence</h2> The digital age is upon us, and it is more than clear that AI will dominate it. I would like to pioneer the upcoming digital times skillfully, but also conscientiously and ethically. I am currently vigorously studying modern and traditional AI techniques and have a big project planned. Will be updating this section! 
								<br><br>
								<h2>Computer Graphics</h2> A field that fascinates me immensely. So far, my work in this field has improved my mathematical knowledge and algorithmic thinking tremendously. It has let me
								get super interesting insight into the "how" of computer graphics. Shaders are also really fun! :)<br><br>
								<h2>Game Development</h2> As the focus of my university course, I am constantly developing games, and it really challenges my programming abilities, creativity and UI/UX design. Game development keeps my programming and transferable skills sharp, and is also very satisfying.<br><br>
								<h2 class="major"> Creative skills </h2>
								<h4>Design tools</h4>
								Adobe Photoshop<br>
								Adobe Illustrator <br><br>
								<h4> Video editing tools</h4>
								Adobe Premiere Pro<br>
								Adobe After Effects<br>
								VEGAS Pro<br>

								<br>
								Now, I want to know about you! <br><a href="#email">Could you tell me more about yourself?</a> <br><br>
